    Calibrate your Ubisys J1 blind/shade using automatic motor stall detection.


    **What happens during calibration:**

    1. Blind moves UP until it reaches the top (motor stalls)

    2. Blind moves DOWN until it reaches the bottom (motor stalls)

    3. Blind moves back UP to verify (returns to top)

    4. Device measures and stores total travel distance


    **Duration:** 60-120 seconds depending on blind size


    **Important:** The blind will automatically find its limits no matter where it starts.
    You do NOT need to position it at a specific location before calibration.


    **Works for:** Roller shades, cellular shades, vertical blinds, and venetian blinds.


    Make sure the blind can move freely without obstructions before starting.
